# 🔐 WebVault 🌐

> *The internet changes and forgets, but you don't have to.*

WebVault is a chrome browser extension which helps preserve web pages through local storage and eventually IPFS.

## 📋 Project Description
WebVault allows you to take snapshots of webpages and store them locally. This ensures you always have access to important information, even if data changes, gets censored, deleted or completely disappears. 

With WebVault i strive to add functionality which will allow you to:
- 📸 Take snapshots of any webpage
- 💾 Save and organize all of your archived pages
- 🔍 Browse your saved snapshots anytime
- 🔄 Preserve content forever, through decentralized storage via IPFS


## 🛣️ My Grand Master Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Features 💫
- ~~Implement basic snapshot functionality to save webpages in JSON format~~ [06.05.25 ✅]
- ~~Develop an extension user interface pretty enough that people won't immediately uninstall it~~ [06.05.25 ✅]
- ~~Set up local storage of webpage snapshots~~ [06.05.25 ✅]

### Phase 2: Making It Actually Good 🔄
- Improve how data is structured for easier searching and more relevant data extraction
- Implement better compression methods to reduce storage size
- Add metadata, tags and other relevant data to snapshots

### Phase 3: Features People Want aka Extended Functionality 🔜
- Browse and manage all saved snapshots
- Add search functionality for archived pages that actually works (revolutionary concept)
- Implement export/import functions
- Add scheduling for automatic snapshots of sites that love to "update their terms"

### Phase 4: IPFS Integration 🚀
- Decentralize ALL THE THINGS with IPFS!!!
- Offer ability to share snapshots via IPFS links
- Ensure long-term preservation through the IPFS network, not even cockroaches will stand a chance

### Phase 5: Advanced Features 💡
- Add version history for each webpage
- Implement diff view between different versions
- Alerts of sites with recently updated "terms of service"
- Integrate with other archiving services? Maybe if we're feeling particularly ambitious...

## 💻 Technical Mumbo-Jumbo

Under the hood, WebVault captures DOM content and stores it locally in a structured format. We're not just saving screenshots, that would be way too easy. We're preserving the actual content so you can search through it later.
